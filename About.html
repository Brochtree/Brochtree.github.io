			This website was made for a University assesment. All images where created with either <a href="https://www.dungeonfog.com/">Dungeonfog</a> or <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/">Heroforge</a> by Andrew mactavish. These sites allow fo the use of there materials for non-comercial use's and so mean i can use them for this assesment website. I also recomend these sites for helping to come up with characters and maps for your own worlds and roleplaying games.
