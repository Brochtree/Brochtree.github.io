			As you emerge from the forest you find yourself on a wide road, paved with marble, elegant buildings line the road also made of marble. After walking along the road for a bit longer you realise what you've found as an Elf walks up and greets you. "Welcome to Lustia." This city has been lost for generations. The capital of the elven race!
